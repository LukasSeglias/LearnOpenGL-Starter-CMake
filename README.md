# LearnOpenGL Starter CMake
This CMake project template should give you a quick start to follow the great OpenGL-Tutorials on [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/).

Suggestions for improvements are welcome and appreciated.

# Requirements
You need to have [CMake](https://cmake.org/) installed and should be able to just open the project in your IDE of choice.

# What's inside?
This project includes several of the dependencies used in the tutorials:
- [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad)
- [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)
- [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)
- [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb)

# Known Issues
- Assimp is not included since I haven't gotten it to work.
- There will be many Build-Targets in your IDE of choice. You simply need to build the Target named "learnopengl". 

# Acknowledgement
Many thanks to [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/) for the great content.
